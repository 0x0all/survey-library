            <div class="step-panel">
                Unlike the most others solutions, <a href="https://www.surveyjs.io/">SurveyJS Project</a> contains of three fully independent parts: run-time SurveyJS library, <a href="http://editor.surveyjs.io/">SurveyJS editor</a> and <a href="https://dxsurvey.com/">SurveyJS service</a> for storing and analyzing results. You may stick with the complete solution or use only a library. You may use <a href="https://dxsurvey.com/">SurveyJS service</a> to store your results there or store them in your own storage. You may freely use <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}builder">SurveyJS Editor</a> or integrate <a href="http://editor.surveyjs.io/">the Editor</a> into your own web site.

        <div class="step row">
            <h2>Professional Open Source library</h2>
            <div class="step-panel">
                SurveyJS library is a free and open source solution under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a>. However, professional full-time software developers support it. We have developed software libraries and frameworks since 90th.We know what to do and how to do it. Just look at <a href="https://github.com/surveyjs/surveyjs/tree/master/src">our source code</a>, <a href="https://github.com/surveyjs/surveyjs/tree/master/tests">unit tests</a>, <a href="https://github.com/surveyjs/surveyjs/tree/master/testCafe">functional tests</a> and <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}examples">examples</a> to make up your own mind.

        <div class="step row">
            <h2>A dozen question types</h2>
            <div class="step-panel">
                SurveyJS library has a dozen built-in question types, like <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}examples/questiontype-text.html">a simple text</a> or <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}examples/questiontype-matrixdynamic.html">a complex matrix</a> with different input types, and a <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}examples/questiontype-panel.html">panel (container)</a>. We have all question types you will likely need.

        <div class="step row">
            <h2>Integrate your favorite JavaScript widgets</h2>
            <div class="step-panel">
                Regardless of how many question types a survey library have, there will be always something missing. All survey solutions we have seen, allows using only built-in questions and functionality. SurveyJS gives you an easy way to integrate any JavaScript widget. There are hundreds and thousands different JavaScript widgets on the web. Absolutely the most of them, you may integrate into SurveyJS using our <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}examples/custom-widget-select2-tagbox.html">Custom Widget support feature</a>. It brings a truly unlimited functionality into the library.

        <div class="step row">
            <h2>Design and Bootstrap support</h2>
            <div class="step-panel">
                All professional and commercial survey solutions come with beautiful design. Sometimes you may choose different look and feel. The most commercial survey solutions go further and allow, for example, you even to include your own logo into your own survey. What is a big deal! Will their design match your web site design? You may be lucky if it does. Unfortunately, there is no way they will be able to create a design for all their customers. SurveyJS allows you to <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}examples/survey-customcss.html">customize every element</a> in the way you need. Additionally it supports Bootstrap. If your website uses bootstrap, just tell SurveyJS to render itself by using your bootstrap styles.

            <h2>Represent Survey Model as JSON</h2>
            <div class="step-panel">
                Do you know where a typical survey solution stores your survey model? Unfortunately, it is rhetorical question. You are likely just do not know. SurveyJS is fully transparent in any aspect, including this one.  SurveyJS library uses JSON to load survey model. You may use <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}builder">WYSIWYG SurveyJS Editor</a> to create the survey, and then copy the created JSON into your web page directly to feed it to the SurveyJS library. Of course, you may store and then load SurveyJS JSON model in SurveyJS service or in your own storage. Survey JSON is readable and you may easily modify it by yourself or simple copy it into SurveyJS Editor and do the needed changes at any time. Finally, nothing to stop you from creating or modifying a SurveyJS Model in the code in run-time. At the end, it is just JavaScript objects.

        <div class="step row">
            <h2>Survey Results as JSON</h2>
            <div class="step-panel">
                As you may imagine, the SurveyJS result is a JSON as well. You may get the JSON result at any time, for example: on survey complete, on page change or value change. You may set to the SurveyJS a previously <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}examples/survey-data.html">entered result or predefined data</a>. Of course, you may get or set the value of an individual question at any moment as well.
            </div>                    
        </div>
        <div class="step row">
            <h2>Survey Flow</h2>
            <div class="step-panel">
                The most complex surveys need to change the survey flow. You have to change the questions, panels and pages visibility or skip some pages. SurveyJS provides you with <a  href="{{ page.pathprefix }}examples/condition-kids.html">an easy way to achieve this</a>.
            </div>                    
        </div>
        <div class="step row">
            <h2>Dynamic questions</h2>
            <div class="step-panel">
                In many cases, the survey question models have to be dynamic. The data should come from different services and could not be static. SurveyJS gives you the ability to <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}examples/questiontype-dropdownrestfull.html">load the data from restful API</a> without writing a single line of code. Of course, you are free to change the survey model in the code, it gives you again an unlimited possibilities.
            </div>                    
        </div>
        <div class="step row">
            <h2>Localization and Multi-languages support</h2>
            <div class="step-panel">
                We are not native English speakers ourselves and of course, we fully understand the importance of product localization. Like many other libraries, we are offering the translation of SurveyJS strings for many languages. It is created and supported by the community. However, what about multi languages support in one survey? What happens if you have to run the same survey, for example, for your English and Spanish speaking clients. Should you create two different surveys? SurveyJS has <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}examples/survey-multilanguages.html">a built-in support for multi-languages</a>. Something, you will unlikely find in the most survey solutions.

            <h2>Find out even more</h2>
            <div class="step-panel">
                We may continue to talk about SureyJS library functionality, like <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}examples/survey-displaymode.html">display mode</a> (for reviewing the results), <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}examples/validators-standard.html">answers validation</a>, <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}examples/survey-processtext.html">text pre-processing</a>, <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}examples/survey-customnavigation.html">custom navigation</a> and more. You may look at <a href="{{ page.pathprefix }}examples">our examples</a> and explore them by yourself. If, for some reason, you find that SurveyJS library misses a required functionality, then create <a href="https://github.com/surveyjs/surveyjs/issues">an issue in the SurveyJS GitHub repo</a> and we do our best to assist you.
